For this week's challenge of the Rutgers Data Visualization and Analytics Bootcamp, our class was given real market data sets for stock prices and were tasked to create a VBA Script Macro in order to calculate the following: 

- Ticker Symbol 
- Total Stock Volume 
- Yearly Change 
- Percent Change 
- Greatest % Increase 
- Greatest % Decrease 
- Greatest Total Volume

Included in this Repository entitled "vba_challenge_stocktrends" you will find the following: 

- Initial VBA Challenge Prompt 
- Three screenshots of my final spreadsheet solutions after the macro is ran
- VBA Script I created in order to run my Stock Trend Macro

This week's challenge provided me with an extremely valuable skill that can easily be used and translated into real world market data.
